## The official scorekeeping app for the fast-growing game of Bowlf

## Rules
Bowlf is played in a standard bowling alley with standard bowling balls and pins.

The goal of the game, as with golf, is to be the competitor with the lowest score at the end of the game.

* Competitors take turns throwing the bowling ball down the lane toward the pins, attempting to hit as few as possible without the ball entering the gutter.
* Each competitor must make two attempts per round of the game.
* After each set of two attempts, the competitor is awarded points equal to the number of pins knocked down, plus eight points for each gutter ball.
* If the first attempt knocks down all pins, the competitor is immediately awarded ten points and does not make their second attempt.
* The order of play for the first round can be determined by the competitors present, however for each subsequent round competitors should play in an order determined by their scores the previous round (*not* cumulative scores), where lower scores play earlier. In the case of a tie, the tied competitors should play a single game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, the winner of which will play first.
